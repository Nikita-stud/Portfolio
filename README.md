<h1>My Portfolio Website</h1>

My own portfolio website is for you to look through my progress and maybe eventually decide to get me onboard of whatever cool idea or project you have going on. The website focuses on the academic progress of my acquired skills.

<h4>Getting Started</h4>
Installing
This is where you list how to get the project started. It typically just includes telling a person to clone the repo and then to install the dependencies e.g.

Clone the repo:
git clone git@github.com:NoroffFEU/portfolio-1-example.git
Install the dependencies:
npm install
Running
Here is where you detail how to run the app. It typically involves the commands you'd need to run to start the project e.g.

To run the app, run the following commands:

npm run start
Contributing
Here you can detail any information you want to provide regarding contributing to the project. For big projects you will usually have a separate CONTRIBUTING.md and link to it, but for smaller projects you can simply include instructions here. These instructions can simply detail the process you want a person to take, such as to make sure to open a pull request so code can be reviewed.
