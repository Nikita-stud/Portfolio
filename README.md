My Portfolio Website

My own portfolio website is for you to look through my progress and maybe eventually decide to get me onboard of whatever cool idea or project you have going on. The website focuses on the academic progress of my acquired skills.

Contributing
Here you can detail any information you want to provide regarding contributing to the project. For big projects you will usually have a separate CONTRIBUTING.md and link to it, but for smaller projects you can simply include instructions here. These instructions can simply detail the process you want a person to take, such as to make sure to open a pull request so code can be reviewed.

You can link to your license file here if you're using one, or mention what license the codebase falls under. If you're unsure then you can simply delete this section.

Acknowledgments
This is where you can add any acknowledgements if you'd like, such as to people who have helped you or any code snippets you'd like to mention. You can delete this section if you don't have any acknowledgements to make.
